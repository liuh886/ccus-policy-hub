## Policy Overview

Germany’s 2024 Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (ICMS) represents a historic pivot in the nation's climate policy. Officially approved by the Federal Cabinet in May 2024, the strategy confirms that large-scale CCS/CCU is essential for reaching Germany's 2045 climate neutrality goal. The framework’s most significant breakthrough is the authorization of offshore CO2 storage within Germany’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf, alongside an 'opt-in' mechanism allowing individual federal states to permit onshore storage at their discretion.

To implement the strategy, the government is amending the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act (KSpG) to establish a clear legal regime for CO2 pipeline construction and to legalize the export of CO2 for international sequestration. By declaring CO2 infrastructure to be of 'overriding public interest,' the ICMS aims to radically accelerate permitting and reduce legal hurdles. Critically, the strategy prioritizes hard-to-abate sectors like cement and chemicals, while explicitly excluding coal-fired power plants from network access, ensuring that limited storage resources are utilized for the nation’s strategic industrial transformation.
