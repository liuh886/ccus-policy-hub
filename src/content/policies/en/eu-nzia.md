  market:
    score: 85
    label: Enforced Supply
    evidence: Creates a robust market for storage services by legally mandating the build-out of injection capacity by producers.

    label: Permitting Efficiency
    evidence: The 'Strategic Project' status provides high-value administrative streamlining and reduced timelines for FOAK projects.
    citation: NZIA Streamlining Provisions
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Transfers the financial and operational burden of building storage infrastructure to the oil and gas sector, de-risking the capture side of the value chain through guaranteed sequestration capacity.
  technical: Triggers a massive European-wide characterization of geological storage sites and accelerates the standardization of cross-border CO2 transport protocols.
  environmental: Establishes the world’s first legally binding sovereign storage target (50 Mtpa), providing the physical foundation necessary for the EU to remain on track for climate neutrality by 2050.

title: EU Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA)
description: |-
  ## Policy Overview

  The Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), which entered into force in June 2024, is the legislative backbone of the EU’s strategy to scale up the manufacturing of clean technologies. For the CCS sector, it introduces a groundbreaking mandate: **a Union-wide objective to reach an annual injection capacity of at least 50 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030**. 

  Central to achieving this goal is the **individual contribution obligation for oil and gas producers**. Companies producing crude oil and natural gas in the EU are legally required to contribute to this 50 Mtpa storage target pro rata to their share of production between 2020 and 2023. By holding emitters responsible for building the necessary infrastructure, the EU aims to eliminate the 'chicken-and-egg' dilemma that has long stalled sequestration projects. Furthermore, CCS Hubs designated as 'Net-Zero Strategic Projects' benefit from accelerated permitting, synchronized cross-border regulatory frameworks, and prioritized access to EU and national funding, solidifying CCS as a pillar of European industrial autonomy.
interpretation: The NZIA is the first EU legislation to turn CO2 storage capacity into a 'legal obligation', mandating O&G producers to contribute to regional goals.
