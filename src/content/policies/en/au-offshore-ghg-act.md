legalWeight: Primary Legislation
description: |-
  ## Policy Overview

  Australia’s 2023 Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment represents a critical legislative milestone for the international CCUS market. It rescinds the previous prohibition on exporting captured CO2, formally permitting the transport of Australian-captured carbon to offshore reservoirs in other jurisdictions for permanent sequestration. This change aligns domestic law with the 2009 and 2013 amendments to the London Protocol, establishing a formal permit regime based on bilateral 'agreements or arrangements' between nations.

  The primary beneficiary of this legislation is the **Bayu-Undan CCS Project** led by Santos, which aims to transport CO2 from the Darwin LNG hub to a depleted reservoir in Timor-Leste waters. Integrated with the existing Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (OPGGS) Act, the framework provides a comprehensive system for offshore licensing, environmental auditing, and liability management. By opening its geological storage potential to partners like Japan and South Korea, Australia is positioning itself as the 'Carbon Sink of the Asia-Pacific,' turning its offshore assets into a strategic export-grade carbon management service.
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Resolves the fatal regulatory risk for cross-border projects, enabling billion-dollar FID decisions and significantly deferring the massive decommissioning costs of offshore assets.
  technical: Drives the technical standardization of long-distance sub-sea CO2 pipelines and high-pressure injection wellheads, solidifying Australian expertise in offshore plume monitoring.
  environmental: Provides the physical decarbonization pathway for Australia's massive LNG export industry, ensuring that high-CO2 gas fields can reach net-zero operational status.
