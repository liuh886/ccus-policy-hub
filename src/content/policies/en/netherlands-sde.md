impactAnalysis:
  economic: Internalizes the carbon price through a stable 15-year payout, turning volatile ETS signals into bankable cash flows for multi-billion euro infrastructures.
  technical: Drives the development of open-access Hub-and-Spoke transport networks (Porthos/Aramis), enabling multi-sector industrial capture at scale.
  environmental: The financial backbone of the Dutch industrial transition, targeting over 10 Mtpa of storage by 2030 to meet Paris Agreement commitments.

  ## Policy Overview

  The Netherlands' SDE++ scheme is a premier global example of the Carbon Contract for Difference (CCfD) model, designed to bridge the 'unprofitable component' of decarbonization technologies. For CCS and CCU, the scheme provides a 15-year operating subsidy that covers the gap between the full project cost (Base Price) and the market value of avoided emissions (EU ETS Price).

  In 2024, the scheme was significantly updated with a maximum subsidy intensity of **€400 per tonne of CO2 saved**. SDE++ has been instrumental in the FID of the Porthos project, providing €2.1 billion in grant reservations for major industrial players in the Rotterdam area. Critically, as of 2024, the scheme now supports cross-border CO2 storage—allowing Dutch industrial emitters to sequester carbon in Norwegian North Sea reservoirs—solidifying the Netherlands' role as Europe's central carbon management hub.
