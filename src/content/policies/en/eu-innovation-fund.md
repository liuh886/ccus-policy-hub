    score: 100
    label: Up to 100% Grants
    evidence: Highest tier of direct fiscal support globally, with a stable multi-year auction-based revenue stream.
    citation: EU IF24 Call Manual
  strategic:
    score: 90
    label: NZIA Target Alignment
    evidence: Grant allocation is explicitly aligned with the EU’s 2030 50Mt storage milestone.

    score: 85
    label: Performance-Based
    evidence: Disbursements are strictly tied to avoided GHGs using the most advanced lifecycle accounting in the EU.
    citation: IF Annex IV Methodologies
  statutory:
    score: 80
    label: Delegated Framework
    evidence: Transparent, predictable, and legally stable bidding process established by EU delegated law.

    label: Storage Market Catalyst
    evidence: Creates the foundational demand for the 'Storage-as-a-Service' model across European industrial clusters.
    citation: IF Impact Assessment 2024
impactAnalysis:
  economic: By providing 60-100% cost coverage, it de-risks multi-billion euro CCUS projects at the pre-FID stage, recycling ETS carbon costs into clean-tech capital.
  technical: Prioritizes cross-sectoral integration (e.g., steel/cement capture connected to shared T&S hubs), fostering technical interoperability across the EU.
  environmental: Directly funds the infrastructure needed to meet the NZIA’s 50 Mtpa storage mandate, anchoring the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality trajectory.

  ## Policy Overview

  The EU Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programs for the deployment of net-zero and innovative technologies, fueled by revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). As the financial heart of the EU Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), it provides critical capital to bridge the commercial gap for large-scale decarbonization projects. For CCUS, the fund covers up to **60% of relevant costs** via traditional grants and up to **100%** through new competitive bidding auctions.

  The 2024 (IF24) call allocated **€2.4 billion** specifically for net-zero technologies. In recent funding rounds, 16 major CCS projects across 18 Member States were selected for nearly €5 billion in grants, contributing significantly to the EU’s legally binding target of 50 Mtpa of CO2 injection capacity by 2030. By absorbing massive CAPEX risks, the fund is the primary catalyst for turning Europe into a global carbon management services market.
