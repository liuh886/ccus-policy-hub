impactAnalysis:
  economic: Codifies CO2 storage as a distinct legal activity with defined property rights, providing the institutional backbone for future foreign direct investment in Romania’s storage market.
  technical: Enforces high-fidelity sub-surface monitoring matching EU directives, forcing technical innovation in reservoir stability tracking within the Romanian petroleum sector.
  environmental: Acts as the legal guarantor for environmental safety, ensuring that carbon sequestration does not compromise local aquifers or regional seismic stability.

title: Romania Law 114/2013 on CO2 Storage
scope: National
tags:
  - Romania CCS
  - EU Transposition
  - ANRMPSG
description: Romania’s Law No. 114/2013 formally transposes the EU CCS Directive into the national legal framework. It mandates that all geological storage projects incorporate a risk-based monitoring plan implemented through all project phases. Managed by the National Authority for Regulation in Mining, Petroleum, and Geological Storage (ANRMPSG), the law establishes the technical and legal requirements for exploration permits, injection licenses, and the eventual transfer of long-term liability. As a country with significant storage potential in Southeastern Europe, this law provides the necessary regulatory certainty for industrial decarbonization and future Hub development.
