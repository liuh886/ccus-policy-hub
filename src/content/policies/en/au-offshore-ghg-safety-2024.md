Australia implemented the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety) Regulations 2024 in June 2025, modernizing the safety landscape for offshore carbon management. The new rules focus heavily on **psychosocial risks** and enhanced worker protection, aligning with international health and safety benchmarks. A critical pillar is the **Design Notification Scheme**, which requires storage projects to submit detailed safety cases to NOPSEMA during the early engineering phase. Furthermore, the regulations shift incident reporting duties to specialized frontline roles, ensuring transparency and establishing the world's most rigorous human-centric safety standards for high-pressure CO2 sub-sea operations.
