Saskatchewan governs its CCS sector through a comprehensive set of Directives managing everything from wellbore integrity to carbon credit trading. In May 2024, the province released the updated **CCUS Credit Standard**, formalizing a trading mechanism and refining the legal definitions of CO2 liability. Critically, in early 2026, the province legislatively confirmed that federal coal-fire emission regulations would not apply in Saskatchewan, cementing a governance path where CCS is used to maintain the lifespan of existing thermal power assets. The framework mandates all storage projects to submit audited emissions returns by July 2025, ensuring high-fidelity monitoring across the province’s diverse sequestration formations.
