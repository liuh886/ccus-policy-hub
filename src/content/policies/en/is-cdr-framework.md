  statutory:
    score: 100
    label: Pioneer Mineralization Law
    evidence: The first jurisdiction to codify mineralization-based storage and issue commercial-scale permits under EU-equivalent rules.
    citation: Icelandic Health and Pollution Prevention Act
  technical:
    score: 100
    label: Mineralization Standards
    evidence: Defines specific technical requirements for the water-dissolved injection method and rapid-mineralization verification.

    label: Tracer-based MRV
    evidence: Mandatory use of chemical tracers and sub-surface modeling to ensure 100% accountability of sequestered plumes.

    score: 90
    label: Negative Emission Hub
    evidence: Strategically positions Iceland as the world's most trusted hub for carbon management services and DAC infrastructure.
    citation: Icelandic Green Economy Roadmap
  incentive:
    score: 60
    label: Market Premium Support
    evidence: Focuses on maximizing the value of carbon credits through alignment with the EU CRCF high-quality removal criteria.
    citation: Ministry of Energy Strategic Directives
impactAnalysis:
  economic: By legally defining mineralization as 'permanent storage,' the framework ensures that Iceland-based CDR credits command a significant price premium in international markets, enabling project bankability for DAC developers.
  technical: Enforces strict chemical tracing and reservoir pressure monitoring, validating the 95% mineralization rate within 2 years—a benchmark for high-fidelity removals.
  environmental: Guarantees the absolute permanence of captured atmospheric CO2, protecting the environmental integrity of negative emission claims toward global 1.5°C goals.

  ## Policy Overview

  Iceland is a global leader in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and basaltic mineralization, having developed a unique regulatory framework that transposes the EU CCS Directive into national law while tailoring it to the country's specific volcanic geology. The framework is pioneered by the **Carbfix** technology, which involves dissolving CO2 in water and injecting it into reactive basaltic formations, where it turns into stone within approximately two years.

  In April 2025, the Environment and Energy Agency of Iceland issued Europe's first EU-compliant onshore storage permit, allowing Carbfix to sequester 106,000 tonnes annually at the Hellisheiði site. This framework supports both point-source capture from geothermal plants and high-profile Direct Air Capture (DAC) installations like Climeworks' Orca and Mammoth. As large-scale hubs like the Coda Terminal advance, Iceland’s CDR framework is establishing the global standard for 'permanent negative emissions,' providing the rigorous MMV and liability protocols needed for the mineralization pathway.
