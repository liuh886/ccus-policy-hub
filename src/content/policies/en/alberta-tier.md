impactAnalysis:
  economic: The CAD 170/t 2030 price target turns CCS from a sunk compliance cost into a bankable asset class, providing world-class revenue certainty for project developers.
  technical: Incentivizes the development of massive 'Hub-and-Spoke' transport networks, proving large-scale industrial capture and storage integration in sub-arctic climates.
  environmental: The primary engine for meeting Canada’s 2030 targets at the provincial level, aimed at decarbonizing the oil sands—the nation's largest emission source.

  ## Policy Overview

  Alberta’s TIER (Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction) system is a globally recognized benchmark for industrial carbon pricing. It functions as a baseline-and-credit market where high-emitting facilities must pay into the TIER Fund or purchase credits to meet emission standards. The 2024-2025 updates brought critical enhancements: the fund price is set at **CAD 95/t** for 2025 and is mandated to rise by CAD 15 annually to **CAD 170/t by 2030**, establishing a rock-solid price floor for CCS investments.

  Furthermore, the amendments raise the compliance offset limit to **90%** by 2026, significantly increasing the market value of 'Sequestration Credits'. Coupled with the **Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program (ACCIP)**, which offers a 12% capital grant designed to stack with Canada’s federal 50% ITC, TIER provides a comprehensive financial stack. This makes Alberta one of the most attractive jurisdictions for large-scale carbon management in sectors like oil sands, petrochemicals, and power.
