  statutory:
    score: 100
    label: State Primary Authority
    evidence: Formally transfers full administrative control over sequestration permitting from federal to state agencies.
    citation: 40 CFR Part 145
  strategic:
    score: 95
    label: Operational De-bottlenecking
    evidence: Identified as the primary strategic fix for federal backlog issues, enabling the physical deployment of IIJA/IRA assets.

    score: 90
    label: Federal Oversight Rigor
    evidence: States must enforce federal monitoring standards and submit to annual EPA performance audits.

    score: 70
    label: Administrative Stimulus
    evidence: Accelerated timelines act as an implicit financial incentive by reducing carrying costs and improving project NPV.

    score: 80
    label: State-level Competition
    evidence: Drives institutional competition between states to offer the most efficient and reliable regulatory environment for CCS.
    citation: Louisiana DNR Primacy Announcement 2024
impactAnalysis:
  economic: By cutting administrative delays by 50%, primacy protects billions in 45Q tax assets from expiration and lowers pre-FID development interest expenses for major hubs.
  technical: Propels state-level geological expertise and ensures high-fidelity integration between state sub-surface databases and the federal EPA GGRDW reporting system.
  environmental: Ensures that administrative speed does not compromise safety, as states must maintain regulatory stringency at or above the federal SDWA baseline for drinking water protection.

  ## Policy Overview

  Class VI Primacy is the most critical regulatory mechanism for accelerating the development of the US CCS market. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the EPA is responsible for overseeing the injection of CO2 into Class VI wells but allows qualified states to assume primary enforcement authority. As of late 2025, the program achieved massive scale with **Louisiana (Feb 2024)** and **Texas (Dec 2025)** joining North Dakota and Wyoming as primacy states.

  The real-world impact of primacy is the drastic reduction in permitting timelines. While federal reviews often exceed 24 months, primacy states have demonstrated the ability to cut approval times in half. This acceleration is essential for project bankability under the 45Q tax credit, which requires construction to commence by the end of 2032. With Texas alone managing over 30 pending applications at the time of transfer, state-led primacy provides the administrative bandwidth necessary to scale the US from demonstration projects to a unified national sequestration infrastructure.
