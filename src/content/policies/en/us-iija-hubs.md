## Policy Overview

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), represents the most significant investment in carbon management infrastructure in US history. It allocates approximately **$12 billion** across several programs administered by the Department of Energy (DOE). Key highlights include **$3.5 billion** for Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hubs (targeting 4 hubs with >1 Mtpa capacity each), **$2.5 billion** for Carbon Capture Demonstrations, and **$2.25 billion** for the Carbon Storage Validation and Testing Program (CarbonSAFE).

In 2024, the program hit major milestones, with over $518 million awarded to 23 storage-focused projects across 19 states. Unlike the 45Q tax credit, which provides operational support, IIJA funding targets the 'public utility' aspects of CCUS—shared transport networks and centralized storage complexes. This dual-track approach (IIJA for CAPEX/Infrastructure and IRA for OPEX) creates a robust fiscal environment intended to solidify US leadership in the global carbon management sector.
