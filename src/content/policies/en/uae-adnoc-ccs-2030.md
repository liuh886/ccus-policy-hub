  ## Policy Overview

  ADNOC, the UAE's state-owned energy giant, is aggressively scaling its CCUS capacity with a revised target of **10 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) by 2030**, double its previous goal. This strategy is central to achieving ADNOC's accelerated Net Zero 2045 ambition. Key pillars include the operational Al Reyadah facility—the world's first commercial iron and steel carbon capture plant—and the newly approved Habshan CCS project.

  The Habshan project, targeting 1.5 Mtpa by 2026, marks a pivotal expansion of ADNOC’s integrated carbon management infrastructure. By sequestering CO2 into mature oil fields like Bab Far North, ADNOC aims to produce the 'world's lowest carbon intensity' oil and gas. Backed by a $23 billion commitment to lower-carbon solutions, this strategy transforms the UAE's natural resources into a strategic advantage in the future global market for blue energy and certified low-carbon products.
