  - Direct Funding
description: India's 2026-27 Union Budget represents a historic fiscal commitment to carbon management, allocating **200 billion rupees** (~$2.2 Billion USD) over five years. The centerpiece is the 'Viability Gap Funding (VGF)' mechanism, specifically designed to de-risk high-CAPEX sequestration projects in the cement, steel, and refining sectors. Launched alongside the 2025 National CCUS R&D Roadmap, the policy promotes a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model to establish regional sequestration hubs across India’s major industrial corridors, providing the financial motor for the nation’s 2070 net-zero trajectory.
