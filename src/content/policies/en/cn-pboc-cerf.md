  ## Policy Overview

  The Carbon Emission Reduction Facility (CERF), launched by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is the financial cornerstone for CCUS deployment in China. Operating on a 'lead-loan-then-refinance' mechanism, the PBOC provides 60% of the principal for loans issued by qualifying financial institutions to key decarbonization sectors, including CCUS. The interest rate for this facility was recently reduced to an ultra-competitive **1.25%** in early 2026.

  Crucially, the implementation period has been extended to **the end of 2027**, providing a multi-year window of financial predictability for capital-intensive carbon management infrastructure. By mid-2024, CERF had mobilized over 1.1 trillion CNY in green loans, contributing to an annual reduction of nearly 200 million tonnes of CO2. For CCUS developers, this policy effectively bridges the financing gap by leveraging central bank capital to lower commercial borrowing costs, driving the industrialization of carbon capture technologies.
