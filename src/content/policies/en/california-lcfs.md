title: California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) 2024/2025 Amendments
description: A premier market mechanism allowing CCUS projects to generate tradable credits based on CI reduction. LCFS credits can be stacked with federal 45Q credits for maximum incentive value.
interpretation: The LCFS CCUS protocol is a premier market mechanism. Its 'credit stacking' potential with 45Q significantly enhances the ROI for capital-intensive projects like DAC.
