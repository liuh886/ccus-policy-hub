impactAnalysis:
  economic: The mandatory 4.9% baseline decline rate increases carbon costs for polluters, pivoting CCS into a cost-competitive compliance strategy.
  technical: Specifically mandates net-zero reservoir CO2 for new LNG developments, directly securing the market for large-scale offshore storage.
  environmental: Serves as the key driver for Australia's 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, covering 28% of national emissions.
