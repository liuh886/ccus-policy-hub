## Policy Overview

The US 45Q tax credit, enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, is a global benchmark for CCUS incentives. Key enhancements include increasing the credit value to **$85/t** for industrial and power facilities and **$180/t** for Direct Air Capture (DAC). The IRA introduced revolutionary 'Direct Pay' and 'Transferability' mechanisms, allowing tax-exempt entities and developers to monetize credits directly, significantly improving project bankability.

Furthermore, the legislation extended the construction start deadline to **2033**, providing a stable decade-long investment window. To promote high-quality domestic jobs, the full credit rates are tied to 'Prevailing Wage' and apprenticeship standards. If these are not met, the credit is reduced by 80%. This policy acts not only as a decarbonization tool but as a national strategic engine for US energy independence and industrial modernization.
