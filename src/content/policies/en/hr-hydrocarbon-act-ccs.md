impactAnalysis:
  economic: Reduces regulatory volatility for fossil-asset owners transitioning to carbon management, utilizing public geological funds to de-risk multi-million EUR private FIDs.
  technical: Standardizes high-pressure CO2 injection and plume monitoring protocols tailored for the Adriatic region’s specific geological features.
  environmental: Anchors Croatia's 2050 climate inventory in physical and verifiable removals, ensuring that hard-to-abate industrial emissions are permanently isolated from the atmosphere.

description: Croatia has integrated the EU CCS Directive into its national legal framework through the Act on the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons. The legislation designates the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency (AZU) as the primary regulator for sequestration titles. Amendments in 2019 and 2021 specifically codified the permanent storage of CO2, backed by a €4 million state-funded study to identify suitable sub-surface formations. While navigating minor overlaps with mining laws, the Act serves as the foundation for Croatia’s post-2040 industrial decarbonization, particularly for its natural gas power and fertilizer sectors, positioning the nation as a strategic carbon sink in the Balkans.
