impactAnalysis:
  economic: Unlocks an estimated RM 20 Billion in investment per Hub by providing clear property rights for sub-surface storage, converting natural geological assets into a scalable service-based export commodity.
  technical: Enforces international standards for reservoir integrity and sub-sea leakage detection, accelerating the technical maturity of offshore-to-sequestration conversions in the Asia-Pacific.
  environmental: Provides the physical and legal guarantee for permanent CO2 isolation, serving as the cornerstone for Malaysia’s NETR goals and regional 1.5°C contributions.

  ## Policy Overview

  Malaysia’s Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Act 2025 is the first standalone primary legislation in Southeast Asia covering the entire CCUS value chain. Coming into force on August 1, 2025, the Act establishes the **Malaysia Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage Agency (MyCCUS)** as the sole federal regulator for licensing, safety, and compliance. The framework introduces a sophisticated two-tier licensing system: **Assessment Permits** for preliminary geological characterization and **Storage Licences** for active injection and long-term reservoir management.

  Strategically, the Act formalizes the international movement of CO2, positioning Malaysia as a premier regional hub for carbon sequestration services. By leveraging its vast offshore depleted gas fields (estimated at 15 Mtpa capacity), the legislation enables the import of CO2 from land-constrained nations like Japan and South Korea. Furthermore, it addresses long-term liability through a mandated **Post-Closure Stewardship Fund**, financed by injection levies, ensuring that environmental monitoring is sustained for decades beyond the project lifecycle.
