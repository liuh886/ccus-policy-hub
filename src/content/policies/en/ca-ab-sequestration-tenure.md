analysis:
  statutory:
    score: 100
    label: Codified Pore Rights
    evidence: Established a robust legal regime for pore space ownership and leasing, a world-first in resolving sub-surface tenure.
    citation: Mines and Minerals Act & Sequestration Regulation
  strategic:
    score: 90
    label: Strategic Hub Selection
    evidence: Uses a centralized bidding process to prioritize efficient, large-scale storage complexes over fragmented small sites.
    citation: Alberta Sequestration Tenure RFFP
  mrv:
    score: 90
    label: AER Directive 065
    evidence: Mandates rigorous monitoring, measurement, and verification protocols overseen by an independent energy regulator.
    citation: AER Directive 065
  market:
    score: 80
    label: Capacity Monetization
    evidence: Exclusive leases turn geological storage into a tradeable and bankable commercial capacity for emitters.
    citation: Atlas Hub Lease Agreement 2024
  incentive:
    score: 60
    label: De-risking via Tenure
    evidence: The provision of legal certainty and a structured liability pathway acts as a critical implicit incentive for FID.
    citation: Tenure Amendment Act 2022/2024
impactAnalysis:
  economic: By establishing exclusive, long-term tenure, it provides the legal certainty needed for the 'Storage-as-a-Service' business model, making large hubs bankable assets.
  technical: Enforces state-of-the-art MMV requirements under AER Directive 065, driving the technical standardization of high-pressure saline aquifer injection and monitoring.
  environmental: Provides the legal guarantee for permanent isolation of industrial emissions, ensuring the integrity of the 1 Mt+ sequestered annually in Alberta.

  ## Policy Overview

  Alberta’s Sequestration Tenure Framework is a global pioneer in the standardized management of pore space rights. Asserting the Crown's ownership over all sub-surface sequestration assets, the framework utilizes a competitive Request for Full Proposals (RFFP) process to award storage rights. In July 2024, the government reached a landmark milestone by signing the first formal **Carbon Sequestration Lease Agreement** with Shell Canada and ATCO EnPower for the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub, granting exclusive rights to inject and store CO2 permanently in specific deep geological formations.

  Regulated by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), the framework mandates strict adherence to MMV (Monitoring, Measurement, and Verification) protocols under AER Directive 065. An updated draft protocol released in late 2024 further refines the quantification of sequestration credits and clarifies shared liability. By linking clear property rights with strategic hub development, Alberta has created a world-class model for preventing resource fragmentation and ensuring the safe, commercial deployment of CCS at scale.
