description: 'France unveiled its updated CCUS deployment roadmap in July 2024, positioning the technology as an essential component of the nation''s industrial decarbonization. The strategy sets ambitious capacity targets: 4-8 Mtpa by 2030 and 30-50 Mtpa by 2050. A key pillar is the launch of **Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfDs)**, providing 15-year revenue support for capture projects. Furthermore, a 2024 bilateral agreement with Norway enables the export of up to 5 Mtpa of French CO2 to North Sea storage sites by 2026. The roadmap prioritizes four key industrial hubs, including Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer, turning them into the physical epicenters of Europe’s expanding carbon management market.'
