## Policy Overview

Longship is the Norwegian government’s ambitious project to demonstrate a complete, large-scale, and cost-effective industrial CCS value chain. With a total budget of NOK 34 billion (approx. €2.94 billion), the Norwegian state funds approximately two-thirds of the costs, covering both capital investment and the first ten years of operations. The project integrates carbon capture at the Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik (400 ktpa) and the Hafslund waste-to-energy plant in Oslo (set for 2029) with the **Northern Lights** transport and storage network.

In mid-2025, Longship reached full operational status as the Northern Lights facility officially opened for commercial use, injecting the first volumes of liquified CO2 into a saline aquifer 2600m beneath the North Sea. The strategic impact of Longship lies in proving the 'Storage-as-a-Service' model, where Northern Lights accepts CO2 from diverse European industrial clusters. By absorbing the massive initial risks, Norway has created the regulatory and technical blueprint for offshore CO2 shipping and storage, anchoring Europe’s industrial decarbonization market.
