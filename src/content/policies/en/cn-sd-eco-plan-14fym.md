Shandong Province’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Ecological Environmental Protection identifies CCUS as the definitive decarbonization path for its heavy industrial clusters in Dongying and Binzhou. The Plan mandates strict capacity controls on steel and aluminum while prioritizing the transformation of traditional energy bases like the Shengli Oilfield into integrated **'Capture-EOR-Storage'** hubs. A distinguishing feature is the formal inclusion of CCUS within the regional environmental risk assessment framework, setting clear safety redlines for large-scale CO2 reinjection. As a major industrial province, Shandong uses this plan to pioneer the fusion of localized environmental governance with national climate targets, providing the legal foundation for world-class projects like the Shengli CCUS demo zone.
