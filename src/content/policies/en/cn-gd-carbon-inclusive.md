description: 'Guangdong Province released its updated 2024 Carbon Allocation and Offset Rules in March 2025, allowing covered entities to use offset credits (CCERs and local PHCERs) for up to **10%** of their verified emissions. A key innovation is the ''Local Stimulus'' mandate: 70% of used credits must originate from projects within Guangdong. For CCUS demonstrations, the province provides a dedicated Carbon Inclusive pathway, allowing physical sequestration outcomes to be monetized at a premium within the regional market. This deep integration between regional carbon pricing and sequestration outcomes provides heavy industry in the Greater Bay Area with a powerful economic driver for rapid decarbonization.'
