  ## Policy Core

  Formally relaunched in 2024, CCER is a critical voluntary emission reduction mechanism for China's dual carbon goals. It provides a commercial pathway for CCUS projects to generate additional revenue through carbon credit trading, with CEA prices consistently exceeding **100 RMB/t**.
interpretation: The 2024 relaunch of CCER establishes a dual-track carbon market in China, providing a robust monetization pathway for CCUS projects.
