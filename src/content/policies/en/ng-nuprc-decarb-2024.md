analysis:
  statutory:
    score: 95
    label: Mandatory Entry Code
    evidence: Legally binds petroleum licensing to carbon management performance, providing NUPRC with high enforcement authority.
    citation: NUPRC Upstream Petroleum Decarbonisation Template 2024
  strategic:
    score: 90
    label: National Net Zero Motor
    evidence: Positions CCUS as the definitive path for protecting Nigeria's energy export competitiveness in a low-carbon world.
    citation: Nigeria Energy Transition Plan (ETP)
  mrv:
    score: 80
    label: Performance Tracking
    evidence: Enforces mandatory GHG reporting and site-level sequestration auditing overseen by a dedicated NUPRC department.
    citation: NUPRC Energy Sustainability Guidelines
  market:
    score: 75
    label: VCM Integration
    evidence: Strategically encourages participation in global carbon markets to monetize sequestration credits and offset project OPEX.
    citation: Nigeria SGI Pillar 3 - Carbon Markets
  incentive:
    score: 50
    label: Compliance Dividend
    evidence: Incentivizes long-term investment by offering regulatory stability and a streamlined pathway for 'green' asset approval.
    citation: Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) Implementation Rules
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Links decarbonization performance directly to asset ownership, compelling IOCs to reinvest capital into local CCS infrastructure to protect their multi-billion dollar petroleum licenses.
  technical: Accelerates technical expertise in tropical point-source capture and depleted field sequestration, specifically targeting the resolution of Nigeria's systemic gas flaring challenges.
  environmental: Acts as the legal guarantor for Nigeria’s emission reductions, ensuring that industrial removals are physically verified and permanently sequestered to meet national NDC targets.

title: Nigeria NUPRC Upstream Petroleum Decarbonisation Template (UPDT)
scope: National
tags:
  - Nigeria Hub
  - Petroleum Industry
  - CCUS Mandate
description: In late 2024, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) introduced the Upstream Petroleum Decarbonisation Template (UPDT), a mandatory regulatory tool for any licensee or lessee in the oil and gas sector. Effective January 2025, compliance with the UPDT is a prerequisite for obtaining and renewing upstream permits. The framework identifies CCUS as a primary lever for zero flaring and blue hydrogen production, mandating that operators submit detailed CCS deployment roadmaps. This bold policy shift marks Nigeria’s transition to using administrative leverage to force the adoption of carbon management technologies, anchoring its 2060 net-zero ambition in rigorous industrial compliance.
