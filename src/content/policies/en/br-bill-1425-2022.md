impactAnalysis:
  economic: Resolves fundamental property rights issues for sub-surface storage, providing Petrobras and private investors with the legal security needed for multi-billion USD FIDs in the pre-salt basins.
  technical: Enforces technical standardization for high-pressure injection in deep-water pre-salt environments, establishing Brazil as a technical authority in offshore storage integrity.
  environmental: The cornerstone of Brazil's green transition, aimed at scaling Bio-CCS to achieve net-negative carbon intensities for the nation’s dominant biofuels industry.

description: Brazil’s Bill 1425/2022 is the definitive legislative vehicle for establishing the legal status of Carbon Capture and Storage in the country. Approved by the Senate in late 2023 and integrated with the 'Fuels of the Future' Act (PL 528/2023) in October 2024, it designates the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) as the primary regulator. The Bill codifies a 30-year post-closure monitoring period and a specialized leasing regime for geological pore space. Strategically, it leverages Brazil’s massive potential in bio-ethanol capture and pre-salt oil reservoir sequestration to position the nation as a global negative-emission leader and a source of high-integrity carbon removals.
