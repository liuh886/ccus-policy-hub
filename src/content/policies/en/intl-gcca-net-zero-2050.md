The GCCA 2050 Roadmap is the definitive global blueprint for decarbonizing the built environment’s foundational material. It targets a **25% reduction by 2030** and identifies **CCUS** as the single largest lever for reaching net-zero by 2050, projected to contribute 36% of total industry abatement. The roadmap provides a standardized multi-pathway strategy—incorporating clinker substitution, alternative fuels, and recarbonation. Representing 80% of global production outside China, the framework establishes the technical baselines and financial arguments needed to unlock large-scale public and private financing for cement-sector capture retrofits.
