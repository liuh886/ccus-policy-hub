impactAnalysis:
  economic: Utilizes Aramco’s massive balance sheet to bypass traditional project finance barriers, establishing blue hydrogen as a high-margin premium export commodity.
  technical: Drives world-class innovations in high-pressure sequestration within desert and offshore saline formations, standardizing capture from sour gas streams.
  environmental: A key motor for the Kingdom’s 2060 net-zero trajectory, facilitating the permanent removal of millions of tonnes of CO2 from the global energy supply chain.

title: Saudi Arabia Hydrogen Strategy & CCS Coupling
scope: National
tags:
  - Blue Hydrogen
  - Vision 2030
  - 11 Mtpa Target
description: Saudi Arabia has fully integrated CCS into its National Hydrogen Strategy as the primary vehicle for achieving a 'Circular Carbon Economy.' Saudi Aramco has committed **10% of its 2024-2026 CAPEX** to its New Energies division, focusing heavily on Carbon Capture and blue hydrogen production. The Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) targets 278 Mtpa of emission reductions by 2030, with CCS hubs serving as the physical backbone for this goal. By leveraging its unrivaled geological assets and low-cost natural gas, the Kingdom aims to become the world’s most competitive exporter of low-carbon energy products and high-integrity sequestration services.
