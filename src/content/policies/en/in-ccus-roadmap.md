  ## Policy Overview

  India launched its comprehensive CCUS roadmap in December 2025, signaling a strategic shift for the world's third-largest emitter towards technical decarbonization. Led by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the roadmap outlines a phased approach: Pilot and R&D (2025-2030), Industrial Integration (2030-2035), and Commercial Scale-up (2035-2045).

  To match this ambition, the **2026-27 Union Budget** allocated a historic **200 billion rupees (approx. $2.2 billion USD)** for CCUS over five years. This fund is designed to bridge the viability gap for carbon-intensive sectors such as steel, cement, and power. India is also exploring Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and integration with its domestic Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to maintain export competitiveness under the pressure of global carbon border adjustments like the EU CBAM.
