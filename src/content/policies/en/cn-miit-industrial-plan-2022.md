Released in August 2022 and expanded through 2024, the MIIT Action Plan is the cornerstone of China’s strategy to transition its heavy industry to a low-carbon footing. It mandates sectors including steel, building materials, and petrochemicals to peak emissions by 2030, explicitly promoting the deployment of CCUS as a fundamental technology. The plan shifts CCUS from an experimental technology to a strategic infrastructure requirement, particularly for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). By integrating CCUS with the 'Zero-Carbon Park' and 'Green Factory' evaluation systems, MIIT aims to foster industrial clusters where sequestration is a key operational performance indicator.
