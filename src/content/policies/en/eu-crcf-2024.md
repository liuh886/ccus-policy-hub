impactAnalysis:
  economic: Standardizes CDR as a bankable asset class, reducing methodological risks for investors and enabling premium off-take agreements for high-cost DAC projects.
  technical: Enforces a clear distinction between temporary and permanent storage, driving technical innovation in sub-surface monitoring and biogenic carbon accounting.
  environmental: Guarantees the absolute permanence of carbon removals, safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Union's climate inventory towards the 2040 targets.

  ## Policy Overview

  The EU Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) is the world's first voluntary framework providing a unified legal definition for high-quality carbon removals. Enacted via Regulation 2024/3012, it establishes the 'QU.A.L.ITY' criteria—Quantification, Additionality, Long-term storage, and Sustainability—to verify carbon sequestration activities across the Union. For the CCUS sector, the CRCF is transformative as it formally classifies **DACCS (Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage)** and **Bio-CCS (Bio-energy with CCS)** as 'Permanent Carbon Removals'.

  By creating a centralized Union Registry and enforcing strict third-party auditing, the CRCF aims to eliminate 'greenwashing' and provide corporate buyers with the legal certainty needed to procure high-value carbon removals. This framework acts as the regulatory bridge for expensive but critical negative emission technologies to achieve commercial scale, ensuring that every certified tonne is a tangible contribution to the EU’s 2040 and 2050 climate neutrality targets.
