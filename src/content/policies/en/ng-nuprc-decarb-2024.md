In late 2024, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) introduced the Upstream Petroleum Decarbonisation Template (UPDT), a mandatory regulatory tool for any licensee or lessee in the oil and gas sector. Effective January 2025, compliance with the UPDT is a prerequisite for obtaining and renewing upstream permits. The framework identifies CCUS as a primary lever for zero flaring and blue hydrogen production, mandating that operators submit detailed CCS deployment roadmaps. This bold policy shift marks Nigeria’s transition to using administrative leverage to force the adoption of carbon management technologies, anchoring its 2060 net-zero ambition in rigorous industrial compliance.
