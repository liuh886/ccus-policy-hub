description: The UAE’s Net Zero 2050 Strategy is the nation’s primary executive roadmap for climate and economic diversification. It identifies CCUS as a critical technology, aiming to abate **32%** of industrial sector emissions via carbon sequestration. In June 2024, the UAE introduced Cabinet Resolution No. 67, establishing the **National Register of Carbon Credits (NRCC)**, a pivotal move to formalize carbon asset trading. Complemented by the Federal Decree-Law No. (11) of 2024, the strategy empowers national champions like ADNOC to convert vast offshore depleted fields into global carbon management hubs, cementing the UAE’s leadership in the regional low-carbon economy.
