## Policy Overview

The EU Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programs for the deployment of net-zero and innovative technologies, fueled by revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). As the financial heart of the EU Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), it provides critical capital to bridge the commercial gap for large-scale decarbonization projects. For CCUS, the fund covers up to **60% of relevant costs** via traditional grants and up to **100%** through new competitive bidding auctions.

The 2024 (IF24) call allocated **€2.4 billion** specifically for net-zero technologies. In recent funding rounds, 16 major CCS projects across 18 Member States were selected for nearly €5 billion in grants, contributing significantly to the EU’s legally binding target of 50 Mtpa of CO2 injection capacity by 2030. By absorbing massive CAPEX risks, the fund is the primary catalyst for turning Europe into a global carbon management services market.
