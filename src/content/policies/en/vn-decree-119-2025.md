description: Issued in June 2025, Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP is the primary executive order governing Vietnam's transition to a structured carbon economy. It establishes the **National Registration System** for GHG quotas and credits and mandates an emission allowance pilot for the power, steel, and cement sectors during 2025-2026. For the CCUS sector, the Decree provides the first legal recognition of sequestration outcomes as tradeable offsets within the domestic system. By delegating methodology development to MONRE, the framework provides the institutional certainty required for international investors to leverage Vietnam’s offshore sequestration potential as part of the regional low-carbon supply chain.
