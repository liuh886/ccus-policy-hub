    score: 60
    label: Institutional Stimulus
    evidence: Links CCUS adoption to priority access for land, energy quotas, and favorable interest rates from state-owned banks.
    citation: Green Manufacturing Management Measures
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Incentivizes the flow of green finance toward industrial capture retrofits by making carbon management a core component of state-led manufacturing performance audits.
  technical: Accelerates the development of localized capture solutions for low-concentration flue gas from industrial kilns and blast furnaces, fostering full-chain technology maturity.
  environmental: Anchors the decarbonization of China's most carbon-intensive industrial sectors, providing the physical storage capacity needed to achieve absolute emission reductions.

title: China MIIT Action Plan for Industrial Carbon Peaking
scope: National

description: Released in August 2022 and expanded through 2024, the MIIT Action Plan is the cornerstone of China’s strategy to transition its heavy industry to a low-carbon footing. It mandates sectors including steel, building materials, and petrochemicals to peak emissions by 2030, explicitly promoting the deployment of CCUS as a fundamental technology. The plan shifts CCUS from an experimental technology to a strategic infrastructure requirement, particularly for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). By integrating CCUS with the 'Zero-Carbon Park' and 'Green Factory' evaluation systems, MIIT aims to foster industrial clusters where sequestration is a key operational performance indicator.
