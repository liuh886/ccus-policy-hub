# Evaluation & DMRV Standards

Our evaluation framework is built upon the FSRTM scoring model and Digital MRV (DMRV) protocols.

## FSRTM Scoring Model

We evaluate policies across five dimensions:
- **Incentive**: Financial and non-financial support.
- **Statutory**: Legal and regulatory framework.
- **Market**: Market-based mechanisms.
- **Strategic**: Long-term vision and integration.
- **MRV**: Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification requirements.
