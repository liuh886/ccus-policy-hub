The CCS+ Initiative is a high-level industry consortium—led by global energy and technology giants including TotalEnergies and SLB—dedicated to establishing a unified carbon accounting logic for the voluntary carbon market. In October 2024, Verra formally approved and published the first modules under the CCS+ Framework (VMD0056-0058), covering Direct Air Capture (DAC), transport networks, and saline aquifer storage. By April 2025, the framework expanded to include Bio-energy CCS (BECCS). The initiative serves as critical **'Carbon Asset Infrastructure'**: through its integration with Puro.earth and Nasdaq, CCS+ has turned physical sequestration into a standardized digital language for high-fidelity Carbon Dioxide Removals (CDR). It represents the global technical pinnacle for tracking cross-border transport losses and reservoir permanence across complex supply chains.
