## Policy Overview

The UK Transport and Storage Network Code (TSNC) is the definitive regulatory rulebook for carbon management infrastructure, jointly developed by Ofgem and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). It establishes the technical, commercial, and operational framework for capturing facilities to connect to the national CO2 network. The primary objective of the TSNC is to ensure transparent, non-discriminatory third-party access, preventing infrastructure operators from engaging in natural monopoly behavior.

Following the Financial Close of the East Coast and HyNet networks in late 2024, the Code has moved into full enforcement. It provides comprehensive guidelines for connection applications, dispute resolution (Section C), and interfaces for non-pipeline transport (NPT) like shipping and rail. As the UK transitions toward a self-sustaining CCUS market by 2035, the TSNC serves as the institutional bedrock ensuring that both large-scale and smaller industrial emitters can access sequestration Hubs on fair and predictable commercial terms.
