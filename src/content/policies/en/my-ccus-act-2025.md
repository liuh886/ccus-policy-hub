  ## Policy Overview

  Gazetted in August 2025, Malaysia’s standalone CCUS Act (Act 859) provides the robust legal architecture needed to position the nation as a premier carbon management hub in the Asia Pacific. The Act mandates the creation of the Malaysia CCUS Agency (MyCCUS), which serves as a one-stop regulatory body for the entire value chain. Covering Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan, the legislation focuses on streamlining offshore exploration and storage permits.

  At its core, the Act aims to **monetize Malaysia's vast offshore geological storage capacity**. By providing a clear legal framework for cross-border CO2 transport and permanent storage, it enables PETRONAS and its international partners to develop large-scale regional hubs. This policy is a central engine of the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), designed to transform carbon storage from an environmental necessity into a new pillar of economic growth.
