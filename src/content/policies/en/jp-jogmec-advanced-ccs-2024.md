## Policy Overview

JOGMEC (Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security) serves as the financial catalyst for the nation’s 2030 goal of storing 6-12 Mtpa of CO2. Through its 'Advanced CCS Projects' program, JOGMEC provides critical funding for Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) and exploratory drilling, effectively de-risking the most uncertain early phases of the CCUS value chain. In June 2024, JOGMEC formally selected **9 flagship projects** for priority support, covering both domestic sites (Tomakomai, Tohoku coast) and international hubs (Malaysia, Oceania).

The strategic importance of this program lies in its dual-track approach: developing local sequestration capacity while simultaneously securing cross-border storage options across the Asia-Pacific. With a combined target capacity of 20 Mtpa—well exceeding the 2030 mandate—this initiative combines direct grants (approx. ¥3.5B in 2024) with equity subscriptions and loan guarantees. The goal is to drive these 9 projects toward a Final Investment Decision (FID) by FY2026, anchoring Japan’s industrial low-carbon transition through state-backed infrastructure.
