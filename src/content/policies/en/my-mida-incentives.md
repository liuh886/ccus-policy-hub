description: The Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) has established a premier fiscal regime for CCUS, recognized as one of the world’s most aggressive. Under the 2024 Budget and subsequent 2024 Gazetted Orders, companies undertaking CCS activities are eligible for a **100% Investment Tax Allowance (ITA)** on qualifying capital expenditure for up to 10 years. Additionally, specialized CCS equipment is fully exempt from import duties and sales tax through 2027. For third-party CCS service providers, a 70% income tax exemption is offered. This 'heavy-subsidy' model dramatically lowers the entry barrier for Malaysia’s emergence as a regional sequestration hub, successfully mobilizing global capital toward its offshore storage assets.
