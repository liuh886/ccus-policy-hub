## Policy Overview

Promulgated in February 2024 and effective from February 2025, South Korea’s CCUS Act is a landmark piece of legislation that unifies the regulation of the entire value chain. By integrating fragmented rules previously managed by different ministries, the Act provides a stable legal foundation for industrialization. A key highlight is the legal classification of captured CO2 and its derivatives as non-waste, exempting them from restrictive waste management laws and facilitating cross-border carbon trade.

The Act also introduces a **Cluster Designation System**, where local governments can propose industrial hubs to receive central government subsidies, administrative fast-tracking, and public land rent exemptions. This approach leverages economies of scale to accelerate the deployment of CCUS infrastructure necessary for South Korea's 2050 Net Zero goal.
