Effective February 2024, Louisiana assumed primary enforcement authority (Primacy) over Class VI injection wells from the EPA. The Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) has codified detailed administrative rules that refine the federal baseline, with a heightened focus on **Community Engagement** and environmental justice. In October 2025, Executive Order JML 25-119 further optimized these standards, mandating that applicants provide verifiable local community benefit plans. While the state is currently undergoing a strategic audit of its backlog, the delegation of authority has the potential to reduce permitting timelines by up to 50%, solidifying Louisiana’s position as a premier jurisdiction for large-scale carbon sequestration Hubs.
