    label: Storage-as-a-Service
    evidence: The creation of Northern Lights JV successfully commercialized storage capacity for international third-party use.

impactAnalysis:
  economic: Dramatically lowers FOAK risks through direct state funding of ~80% of Phase 1 costs, enabling private partners to offer competitive sequestration services to international emitters.
  technical: Establishes the global standard for low-pressure LCO2 shipping and large-scale saline aquifer injection, bridging the infrastructure gap between mainland capture and offshore sinks.
  environmental: Serves as the physical motor for Norway's 2050 climate goals and provides a verified, permanent sink for hard-to-abate sectors across the EU, preventing carbon leakage.

  ## Policy Overview

  Longship is the Norwegian government’s ambitious project to demonstrate a complete, large-scale, and cost-effective industrial CCS value chain. With a total budget of NOK 34 billion (approx. €2.94 billion), the Norwegian state funds approximately two-thirds of the costs, covering both capital investment and the first ten years of operations. The project integrates carbon capture at the Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik (400 ktpa) and the Hafslund waste-to-energy plant in Oslo (set for 2029) with the **Northern Lights** transport and storage network.

  In mid-2025, Longship reached full operational status as the Northern Lights facility officially opened for commercial use, injecting the first volumes of liquified CO2 into a saline aquifer 2600m beneath the North Sea. The strategic impact of Longship lies in proving the 'Storage-as-a-Service' model, where Northern Lights accepts CO2 from diverse European industrial clusters. By absorbing the massive initial risks, Norway has created the regulatory and technical blueprint for offshore CO2 shipping and storage, anchoring Europe’s industrial decarbonization market.
