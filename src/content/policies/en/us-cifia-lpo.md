## Policy Overview

The CIFIA program, established under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), is the federal government’s primary vehicle for financing large-scale CO2 transport networks. Administered by the DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO), the program provides **$2.1 billion** in low-interest federal loans, loan guarantees, and grants. It specifically addresses the high capital risks associated with first-of-a-kind (FOAK) infrastructure, where high upfront costs often outpace early-stage capture demand.

A standout feature of CIFIA is its mandate for 'Common Carrier' status, ensuring non-discriminatory access for third-party emitters. In late 2024, the program launched the **Future Growth Grants**, offering $500 million to subsidize incremental costs for projects that build capacity in excess of current contracts. This forward-looking approach ensures that the US CO2 logistics network can scale rapidly to meet 2030 and 2050 targets, turning fragmented pipelines into a unified, bankable national carbon management infrastructure.
