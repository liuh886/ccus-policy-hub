The concept of 'Zero Carbon Parks' transitioned from local pilots to a national strategic priority in 2025, following its historic inclusion in the State Council's Work Report. In June 2025, the NDRC and MIIT launched the selection process for the first batch of national demonstration zones. This guidance mandates a tri-fold approach: renewable energy integration, systemic energy efficiency, and terminal carbon abatement, explicitly designating CCUS as a critical technology for achieving net-zero physical status. Pioneer regions like Ordos have already codified local standards, aiming to attract global green supply chain investments by providing shared CCS infrastructure and standardized low-carbon institutional advantages.
