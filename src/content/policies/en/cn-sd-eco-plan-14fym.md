analysis:
  strategic:
    score: 90
    label: Regional Ecological Anchor
    evidence: Explicitly links carbon neutrality to provincial ecological redlines, making CCUS a non-negotiable for industrial survival.
    citation: Shandong 14th FYP for Eco-Protection
  statutory:
    score: 85
    label: Provincial Mandate
    evidence: Enforced via Governor’s decree with high regional authority over project permitting and environmental auditing.
    citation: Shandong Government Order [2021] No. 12
  mrv:
    score: 80
    label: Localized Auditing
    evidence: Mandates provincial-level monitoring of groundwater and seismic stability for all sequestration sites within Shandong jurisdiction.
    citation: Shandong Industrial Carbon Accounting Rules
  technical:
    score: 75
    label: Source-Sink Integration
    evidence: Codifies the spatial matching logic between coastal emitters and inland oilfield reservoirs, outlining early pipeline corridors.
    citation: Shandong Dual-Carbon Tech Roadmap
  incentive:
    score: 60
    label: Administrative Fast-track
    evidence: Provides compliant projects with access to provincial environmental funds and expedited green-channel EIA processing.
    citation: Shandong Eco-Protection Fund Rules
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Uses CCUS adoption as a differentiator for industrial asset longevity, allowing compliant facilities to secure operational licenses and emissions rights while guiding provincial green subsidies toward capture retrofits.
  technical: Propels technical integration of CO2-EOR and sequestration within the complex geological settings of the Shengli field, standardizing the conversion of mature onshore oilfields into secure carbon sinks.
  environmental: Ensures the '协同 (Synergy)' effect between greenhouse gas reduction and conventional pollutant control, safeguarding the ecological integrity of the Yellow River basin during industrial transition.

title: Shandong 14th Five-Year Plan for Eco-Protection (CCUS)
scope: Sub-national
region: Shandong

description: Shandong Province’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Ecological Environmental Protection identifies CCUS as the definitive decarbonization path for its heavy industrial clusters in Dongying and Binzhou. The Plan mandates strict capacity controls on steel and aluminum while prioritizing the transformation of traditional energy bases like the Shengli Oilfield into integrated **'Capture-EOR-Storage'** hubs. A distinguishing feature is the formal inclusion of CCUS within the regional environmental risk assessment framework, setting clear safety redlines for large-scale CO2 reinjection. As a major industrial province, Shandong uses this plan to pioneer the fusion of localized environmental governance with national climate targets, providing the legal foundation for world-class projects like the Shengli CCUS demo zone.
