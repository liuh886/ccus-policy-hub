Brazil’s Bill 1425/2022 is the definitive legislative vehicle for establishing the legal status of Carbon Capture and Storage in the country. Approved by the Senate in late 2023 and integrated with the 'Fuels of the Future' Act (PL 528/2023) in October 2024, it designates the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) as the primary regulator. The Bill codifies a 30-year post-closure monitoring period and a specialized leasing regime for geological pore space. Strategically, it leverages Brazil’s massive potential in bio-ethanol capture and pre-salt oil reservoir sequestration to position the nation as a global negative-emission leader and a source of high-integrity carbon removals.
