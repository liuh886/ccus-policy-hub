  technical: Incentivizes the build-out of high-pressure offshore pipeline clusters and advanced reservoir monitoring, standardizing deep-water sequestration protocols across the North Sea.
  environmental: Provides the financial foundation for the permanent isolation of industrial emissions in the NCS, ensuring the credibility of Norway's net-zero contribution and EU climate synergy.

  ## Policy Overview

  The Norwegian Petroleum Tax Act provides a world-leading fiscal environment for offshore CCS operations. With a combined marginal tax rate of **78%** (22% corporate + 71.8% special tax), Norway applies a 'Cash-flow system' where CCS investments since 2022 are 100% deductible in the year they occur against the 71.8% special tax base. 

  Operationally, the regime offers three massive benefits: 1. **CO2 Tax Exemption**: Since 2023, emitters can reclaim CO2 taxes paid on fuel once sequestration is verified; 2. **VAT Exemption**: Cross-border T&S services on the NCS are zero-rated for VAT; 3. **Full OPEX Deductibility**: All maintenance and monitoring costs are fully deductible before tax. Combined with the direct state funding of the Longship project, these provisions de-risk the full value chain for operators like Northern Lights, enabling Norway to serve as the carbon management backbone for Northern Europe.
