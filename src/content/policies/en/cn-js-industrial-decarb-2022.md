description: As a premier industrial hub in China, Jiangsu Province released its decarbonization plan in 2022, prioritizing CCS upgrades for the power and chemical sectors along the Yangtze River. A landmark achievement is the 500,000 tpa Taizhou Capture Project, operational since 2023. The policy specifically encourages the utilization of captured CO2 for **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)** and methanol production, with Sinopec leading megatonne-scale deployments in local oilfields. By integrating CCS with the provincial 'Green Factory' evaluation system, Jiangsu aims to attract high-value global supply chain investments, ensuring that the Yangtze River Delta remains a leader in carbon-efficient manufacturing through 2025.
