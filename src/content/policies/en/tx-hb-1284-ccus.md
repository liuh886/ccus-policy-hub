description: Texas House Bill 1284 is the definitive legislative pillar establishing state sovereignty over carbon sequestration. Enacted to consolidate oversight of Class VI injection wells under the **Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC)**, the bill was the prerequisite for Texas receiving EPA Primacy in December 2025. By centralizing authority, the law resolves administrative overlaps and accelerates the permitting of over 30 pending multi-billion dollar projects. HB 1284 provides the legal clarity needed for sub-surface pore space ownership and establishes a concession-based framework for large-scale commercial Hubs, turning the Gulf Coast into the global epicenter for CCS deployment.
