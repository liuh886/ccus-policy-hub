impactAnalysis:
  economic: The 20-year liability transfer solves the otherwise uninsurable tail-risk of geological storage, creating the long-term certainty required for project financing.
  technical: Mandates state-of-the-art monitoring and reservoir characterization; the 2024 updates further accommodate novel monitoring technologies and sub-surface modeling.
  environmental: Guarantees the absolute permanence of sequestration across the Union, underpinning the environmental credibility of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

  ## Policy Overview

  The EU CCS Directive (Directive 2009/31/EC) is the constitutional foundation of Europe's carbon management legal system. It establishes the highest regulatory standards for the safe geological sequestration of CO2 across the EU, ensuring environmental integrity and public safety. Its most celebrated provision is the **Long-term Liability Transfer mechanism**, which allows operators to hand over monitoring and remediation responsibilities to Member State governments after a minimum of 20 years post-closure, provided storage permanence is verified.

  In 2024-2025, the Directive was significantly bolstered to align with the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) target of 50 Mtpa injection capacity by 2030. The Commission published updated guidance in July 2024 to streamline permitting and introduce more flexible, risk-based financial security requirements. By integrating with the TEN-E regulation for cross-border infrastructure, the Directive serves as the legal backbone for a unified European carbon management market, setting the global benchmark for CCS safety and liability management.
