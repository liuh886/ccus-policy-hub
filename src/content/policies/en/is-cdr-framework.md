## Policy Overview

Iceland is a global leader in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and basaltic mineralization, having developed a unique regulatory framework that transposes the EU CCS Directive into national law while tailoring it to the country's specific volcanic geology. The framework is pioneered by the **Carbfix** technology, which involves dissolving CO2 in water and injecting it into reactive basaltic formations, where it turns into stone within approximately two years.

In April 2025, the Environment and Energy Agency of Iceland issued Europe's first EU-compliant onshore storage permit, allowing Carbfix to sequester 106,000 tonnes annually at the Hellisheiði site. This framework supports both point-source capture from geothermal plants and high-profile Direct Air Capture (DAC) installations like Climeworks' Orca and Mammoth. As large-scale hubs like the Coda Terminal advance, Iceland’s CDR framework is establishing the global standard for 'permanent negative emissions,' providing the rigorous MMV and liability protocols needed for the mineralization pathway.
