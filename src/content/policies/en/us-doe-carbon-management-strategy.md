  ## Policy Overview

  The 2024 US DOE Carbon Management Strategy is the primary execution roadmap for achieving the nation’s 2050 economy-wide net-zero goal. Administered by the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), the strategy systematically prioritizes technological deployment for the next decade. Its twin pillars are achieving a **100% clean power sector by 2035** and total **net-zero emissions across all sectors by 2050**.

  The strategy is built on five core pillars: 1. **Targeted Funding**: Focusing RDD&D on high-impact use cases such as cement and steel decarbonization; 2. **Infrastructure Priority**: Pre-positioning CO2 transport and storage in critical industrial corridors; 3. **Policy Integration**: Coordinating leverage between 45Q, IIJA, and other federal tools; 4. **Community Engagement**: Ensuring equitable benefits through the Justice40 Initiative; and 5. **Climate Diplomacy**: Promoting international standardization. This represents a paradigm shift from individual projects to national-scale, cluster-based operations, positioning the US as a global leader in carbon management services.
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Directs tens of billions in federal funding toward critical technology inflection points, significantly de-risking investments for hard-to-abate industries.
  technical: Formalizes the dual-track roadmap for point-source and Direct Air Capture (DAC), driving the design standards for gigascale shared sequestration Hubs.
  environmental: Acts as the physical framework for the US climate inventory, ensuring carbon management delivers the hundreds of millions of tonnes in annual reductions needed for 2050.
