  ## Policy Overview

  Managed by the Board of Investment (BOI), Thailand's CCUS incentives are a centerpiece of the 2023-2027 'Green Transformation' strategy. Under the 2024 update, projects integrating CCUS in petrochemical and natural gas separation sectors are eligible for the maximum investment incentive: **an 8-year Corporate Income Tax (CIT) holiday**. This policy is specifically designed to offset high initial capital costs and facilitate industrial decarbonization in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).

  Additionally, promoted projects benefit from import duty exemptions on machinery and raw materials for export production. The BOI framework provides crucial financial backing for the country's national energy hub projects, such as PTTEP's initiatives in the Gulf of Thailand. By offering one of the most aggressive fiscal support packages in ASEAN, Thailand aims to attract global clean-tech leaders and secure its path to 2050 carbon neutrality.
