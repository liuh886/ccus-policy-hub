## Policy Overview

Saudi Arabia’s CCUS strategy is built upon the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) framework, a model it successfully championed during its 2020 G20 Presidency. Based on the 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Remove), the strategy sets a massive milestone: reaching **44 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of CO2 storage by 2035**. This is a non-negotiable pillar for the Kingdom’s 2060 Net Zero target.

The flagship Jubail CCS Hub, scheduled for 2027 startup, will initially capture 9 Mtpa, anchored by Aramco’s 6 Mtpa contribution. By leveraging sovereign wealth and Aramco’s engineering dominance, Saudi Arabia is not just decarbonizing but positioning its energy exports—particularly Blue Hydrogen and Blue Ammonia—as the lowest carbon intensity products in the world, securing a long-term competitive edge in the global energy transition.
