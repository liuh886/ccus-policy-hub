  strategic:
    score: 95
    label: Regional Hub Mandate
    evidence: Strategic focus on the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model to achieve economies of scale in the CCUS value chain.
    citation: DOE DAC Hubs 2023 Selection
  statutory:
    score: 90
    label: Codified Federal Law
    evidence: Provides a stable multi-year budgetary framework and clear regulatory mandates for DOE implementation.

    label: OCED Technical Oversight
    evidence: Mandatory adherence to rigorous technical monitoring, life-cycle analysis, and community benefit plans.
    citation: OCED Reporting Guidelines
  market:
    score: 75
    label: Common Carrier Stimulus
    evidence: Funding for shared T&S infrastructure lowers the barrier to entry for smaller industrial capture projects.
    citation: IIJA Carbon Management Provisions
impactAnalysis:
  economic: Dramatically reduces the risk profile of first-of-a-kind (FOAK) infrastructure projects through direct federal grants, enabling multi-billion dollar Hubs to reach FID.
  technical: Propels DAC technology from pilot scales to megatonne commerciality and provides nationwide validation of diversified geological storage formations.
  environmental: Constructs the necessary physical network to enable massive-scale industrial decarbonization, aligning with the US 2050 Net Zero commitment.

  ## Policy Overview

  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), represents the most significant investment in carbon management infrastructure in US history. It allocates approximately **$12 billion** across several programs administered by the Department of Energy (DOE). Key highlights include **$3.5 billion** for Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hubs (targeting 4 hubs with >1 Mtpa capacity each), **$2.5 billion** for Carbon Capture Demonstrations, and **$2.25 billion** for the Carbon Storage Validation and Testing Program (CarbonSAFE).

  In 2024, the program hit major milestones, with over $518 million awarded to 23 storage-focused projects across 19 states. Unlike the 45Q tax credit, which provides operational support, IIJA funding targets the 'public utility' aspects of CCUS—shared transport networks and centralized storage complexes. This dual-track approach (IIJA for CAPEX/Infrastructure and IRA for OPEX) creates a robust fiscal environment intended to solidify US leadership in the global carbon management sector.
